# Task Flow: Your Personal Productivity Powerhouse

Task Flow is a modern, visually engaging task management application designed to help you organize your life, track your progress, and achieve your goals.  It's built with React, utilizes `framer-motion` for smooth animations, and `react-datepicker` for date management. Task Flow aims to go beyond a simple to-do list by incorporating gamified elements like XP, levels, achievements, and streaks to keep you motivated.
